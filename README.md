This is my first web scraping project of Exploratory Data Analysis on Used Cars
My partner in this project is Ms Sunitha Devi Koneti.
We have collected data of 15 Indian cities,from each city we have collected 22 models.
For each model we have collected 13 features or columns.
Like this we have collected raw data of 2890 rows and 13 columns. 
We have uploaded sample files of data collection for two cities.

We have a data cleaning file in which we have removed unneceesry columns and assigned proper unique values.
we have removed null values in transmission column with 'manual'.

We have uploaded a data analysis file also in which we have done univariate,bivariate and multivariate analysis by using diffrent types of plots.
